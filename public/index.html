    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <script>
      tailwind.config = {

    <!-- For development, using Tailwind JIT CDN, ensure this is replaced by a build step for production -->
    <!-- Note: The script `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4` was in the previous version. 
         The official Tailwind docs recommend `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` for play/dev CDN.
         If a specific version or the browser build is needed, adjust accordingly.
         The previous version's package.json had Tailwind, implying a build step.
         For a simple template often a CDN is fine for initial setup.

      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
